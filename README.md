# ü§ñ Four-Layer Artificial Neural Network for Classification and Regression

This repository contains a complete **from-scratch implementation** of a **4-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built using only **NumPy**.  
The model supports both **classification** and **regression** problems ‚Äî showcasing the versatility of ANNs without relying on frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## üöÄ Features

- Fully connected 4-layer neural network (Input ‚Üí Hidden‚ÇÅ ‚Üí Hidden‚ÇÇ ‚Üí Output)
- Works for **both classification** (Softmax output) and **regression** (Linear output)
- Implements:
  - Forward Propagation
  - Backward Propagation
  - Mini-batch Gradient Descent
  - Learning rate scheduling
  - L2 Regularization
- Modular design for easy experimentation
- Training progress with cost and gradient norms displayed
